# About Go
Go was created as system language at Google in 2007 primarily by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, Ken Thomson.  The language was an answer to handle the needs of application development at Google-scale. The designers of Go wanted to mitigate issues such as slow build cycle, language complexity, magical syntax while creating a new language that is simple, safe, consistent, and predictable. 

> “Go is an attempt to combine the safety and performance of a statically-typed language with the expressiveness and convenience of a dynamically-typed interpreted language.” -- Rob Pike
