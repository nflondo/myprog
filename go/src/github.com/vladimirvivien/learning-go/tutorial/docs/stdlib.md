## Standard library APIs
We only scratched the surface with this introduction to Go and its built-in packages.  The following lists additional packages that are part of the standard library:

- Regular expressions with search and replace
- Full support for secure socket programming with TCP/UDP, IPv4, and IPv6
- APIs for writing production-ready HTTP/HTTPS services and clients
- Synchronization primitives (mutex, atomic, etc.)
- General-purpose template framework with HTML support
- Data serialization (JSON, XML, binary, etc)
- Support for multiple RPC wire formats
- Compression algorithms support: tar, zip/gzip, zlib, etc.
- Cryptography support for most major algorithms and hash functions
- Access to OS-level processes, environment info, and signaling
- And much more
