# Getting Started With Go 
This document is a collection of topics designed to help newcomers to get started with the Go programming language.  All code samples, discussed in the sections below, can be found in this repository.

This document is an attempt to cover helpful topics that a Go newcomer would need to know when getting started.  After going through the material here, the reader should be able to understand the fundamentals of the Go programming language and other critical idioms necessary to start creating Go programs.  However, this is by any stretch of the imagination complete.  After going through the material here, it is highly recommend that you grab a good book ([hopefully mine](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-go-programming)) to continue your journey into the Go programming language.

Enjoy!
