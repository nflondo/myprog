                <p>The Latter-day Saints first settled in Payson in 1850. It was 
                    originally named Peteetneet Creek, after Chief Peteetneet, a 
                    Timpanogos Indian chief who lived near Payson's current location. 
                    It was later renamed Payson by Brigham Young.</p>
                <p>Mount Nebo Scenic Byway crosses the Uinta National Forest between the cities 
                    of Nephi and Payson. It climbs to over 9,000 feet in elevation 
                    and provides breathtaking views of Utah valley, the Wasatch 
                    Mountains and 11,928-foot Mount Nebo, the tallest mountain in 
                    the Wasatch Range.</p>
